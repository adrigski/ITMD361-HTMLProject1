        <h1>The official homepage of my website!</h1>
        <p>This website is about myself and topics that I find interesting to include here. I probably will add more to this website in the future on topics that I find interesting. Right now I just have my homepage, resume, and a webpage about emulation.</p>
        
        <h2>Quick About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Adrian, and I'm a first year undergrad ITM major at IIT. Some quick facts about me would be that my favorite things to do is video games, and messing around with computers. I also enjoy modifying and taking apart electrionics like game consoles and smaller devices. My last fact about me is that I was born in Chicago and have been living here my whole life.</p>

        <p>While I do talk about emulation on another page, I wanted to include my reason here because of my interest in PC gaming and console gaming I find emulation, especially video game emulation, fun and interesting and allows me to experience many more games and systems that I may be unable to get the hardware for.</p>
